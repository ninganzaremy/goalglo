# Code Design Principles

1. **Component Structure:**
    - Use functional components with hooks
    - Keep components focused and modular
    - Use PropTypes for type checking

2. **State Management:**
    - Use Redux for global state management
    - Implement Redux Toolkit for simplified Redux logic
    - Use local state (useState) for component-specific state

3. **Action and Reducer Design:**
    - Create separate files for actions and reducers per feature
    - Use async thunks for API calls in actions
    - Implement immer in reducers for immutable state updates

4. **API Integration:**
    - Use the centralized api.js for all API calls
    - Implement interceptors for token handling and error management

5. **Custom Hooks:**
    - Create reusable hooks for common functionalities
   - useForm, useAuthHook, useApiCall

6. **Code Splitting:**
    - Implement lazy loading for routes using React.lazy and Suspense

7. **Real-time Features:**
    - Use WebSockets (socket.io) for real-time notifications and collaborative features
    - Implement optimistic UI updates for improved user experience

8. **Internationalization:**
    - Use react-i18next for managing translations
    - Implement language context for app-wide language state

9. **PWA Implementation:**
    - Use Workbox for service worker management
    - Implement caching strategies for offline functionality

10. **State Management:**
    - Use Redux Toolkit for global state management
    - Implement Redux Toolkit Query for API calls and caching

11. **AI Integration:**
    - Use a dedicated service for AI-related API calls
    - Implement debouncing for chat input to reduce API load

12. **Video Consultation:**
    - Use WebRTC for peer-to-peer video calls
    - Implement a signaling server for WebRTC connection establishment

13. **Data Visualization:**
    - Use D3.js or Recharts for creating custom, interactive charts
    - Implement lazy loading for chart components to improve performance

14. **Accessibility:**
    - Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
    - Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
    - Ensure proper semantic HTML usage
    - Implement ARIA attributes where necessary
    - Ensure keyboard navigation support

15. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Use React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting
    - Implement virtualization for long lists (react-window)
    - Use React.memo for preventing unnecessary re-renders
    - Implement useMemo and useCallback where appropriate

16. **Testing:**
    - Implement E2E tests using Cypress for critical user flows
    - Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) for mocking API calls in tests

17. **Security:**
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
    - Use HttpOnly cookies for storing sensitive information

18. **Code Quality:**
    - Use ESLint with Airbnb config for consistent code style
    - Implement Husky for pre-commit hooks (linting, testing)

19. **Documentation:**
    - Use JSDoc for documenting functions and components
    - Implement Storybook for component documentation and testing

20. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement error boundaries for each major section of the app
    - Use try-catch in async functions and thunks
    - Use a centralized error logging service (Sentry)

21. **Build and Deployment:**
    - Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
    - Implement feature flags for gradual feature rollout
